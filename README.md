# Self Learning Repository

A repository to hold books, courses, articles, and libraries I'm working on reading / testing or have completed and the code that comes with them. Some notable projects will be submodules and be featured on GH as their own repository. Online resources will be linked and books will be in bold.

I will also rate and give my thoughts.
